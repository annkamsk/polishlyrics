From here and from afar  
and walks of mountain ash  
where forests burned  
and wind reached front line
night and cold
Where fields of crops untouched  
Where fruit have rotten black  
Day is nigh  

Sunshine will welcome us to our land  
and look as the blood-soa-ked fields  
feed us again as they coat with rye's  
golden dust  

Women will open their door for us  
and look, they will laugh through the tears  
music will lead us into a dance  
soon enough  

a day, or two,   
a night, or three,  
but not now

a day, a night  
they too shall pass 
dusk will come 

We'll light up the ovens to bake our bread  
and look, where there's ashes and smoke  
blossom will heal up the wounds of war   
life will grow   

Someday our children will shake their heads  
and look, they will laugh that their folks  
cling to the stories of long-gone storms,  
times of woe
