Sitting\
Feeling like quitting\
Maybe it's fitting, there's nothing I can't bear\
Fake it\
But never make it\
I'm gonna take it, but why should I still care\
Drinking\
And wishful thinking\
Stops me from sinking in chaos and dread

Call on me again!\
Days blend together, nothing changes\
I take whatever they provide\
Once I was also going places\
Now I stay inside

Struggle, I need a struggle\
Danger to double\
A villain to defeat\
Meanwhile I'm snoozing\
Constantly losing\
Dreaming of cruising beyond the seven seas\
Then I am falling\
And I'm recalling\
There was a calling for me once before

Call on me again!\
Give me a cause that I can fight for\
I'll take whatever you prepare\
Give me a wrong I can do right for\
Show me any sense

Call on me again!\
Give me a law that won’t abuse me\
Hard work that pays off, pain with gain\
Give me strict rules that won’t confuse me\
That will keep me sane

Call on me again!\
Give me my trials and tribulations\
I need a glory that won't fade\
Give me my lofty aspirations\
Sharp but harmless blade

Call on me again!\
Send me a threshold that increases\
High expectations to exceed\
Send me a war that never ceases\
Please, don’t leave me here

Call on me again!
