Poor, quiet cradle  
Forgotten stable  
Full of heavenly glory  

Baby is sleeping  
No sound of weeping  
Jesus the saviour born here  

Angels flew over  
To watch Him closer  
Lighting the dark with (their) haloes  

Golden hair glowing  
When they are bowing  
Over their heads bright rainbow  

People of goodwill  
Prophecy's fulfilled  
Your misery has ended  

Here comes salvation  
To all the nations  
God born as man descended
